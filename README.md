# Ballista

**Ballista** is a project to explore inter-website and web/native communication;
specifically, communication between one website and another site or native app
of the user's choosing. We want the user to be able to *share* or *edit*
documents in another website or app that the first website has never even heard
of, *choose* documents from another website, or register a website as a *native
file handler*. We're attempting to solve similar problems to the intents system
on Android, but also address other use cases like document editing. Essentially,
we want to create an **interoperability system for the web**.

Our [explainer document](docs/explainer.md) dives deeper into the problem space
and outlines an API that we think solves this problem. But this is less about
proposing an API, and more about starting a conversation, so take a look, and
let us know what you think (contact details below).

## Demo

We have a prototype that works in Chrome and Firefox. Try this:

1. Go to
   [handler-dot-chromium-ballista.appspot.com](https://handler-dot-chromium-ballista.appspot.com)
   (Ballista Editor Demo), and click "OK" to register it as an action handler.
2. Go to
   [requester-dot-chromium-ballista.appspot.com](https://requester-dot-chromium-ballista.appspot.com)
   (Ballista Cloud Demo), and open a file with "Ballista Editor Demo".

These two apps don't know about each other, yet the editor can edit files from
the cloud app. Using our polyfill, you can write a web app that interoperates
with our demo apps in the same way.

You can view and manage app registrations at
[chromium-ballista.appspot.com](https://chromium-ballista.appspot.com). In the
final product, the registration, picking and management UI would be part of the
browser.

## Resources

* For a detailed overview, see [Ballista Explained](docs/explainer.md).
* [Web Share proposal](https://github.com/mgiuca/web-share).
* [Web Share Target proposal](https://github.com/mgiuca/web-share-target).
* In the [`polyfill`](polyfill) directory, there is a polyfill that you can use
  to write a requester that can fire actions at any handler, or a handler that
  can receive actions from any requester.
* The [`handler`](handler) and [`requester`](requester) directories contain the
  source code for the demo apps described above.

See the `README.md` file in each directory for details. Many caveats apply.
